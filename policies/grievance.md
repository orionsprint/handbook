# Grievance Procedure

Telcom Networks prides itself on its good relations with its employees. However, it recognises that, from time to time, you may be unhappy with an aspect of your working life. Most grievances can be resolved quickly and informally through discussion with your Line Manager. If you feel unable to speak to your Line Manager, for example, because the complaint concerns him or her, then you should speak informally to a Senior Manager. If this does not resolve the issue or you wish to raise your concern on a more formal basis, you should follow the procedure below.

Telcom Networks will make reasonable adjustments to this procedure and its operation to cater for employees (or their companions) who have a disability or because English is not their first language. If you think that such adjustments are required in your case, you should let your Line Manager know.
This procedure does not form part of any employees' contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.

## Application of the Grievance Procedure
The procedure is open to any employee wishing to pursue a complaint in relation to their employment. This, for example, may include complaints about:
* terms and conditions of employment;
* perceived inequitable or discriminatory treatment by anyone within Telcom Networks;
* health and safety;
* bullying and harassment;
* new working practices;
* working environment;
* organisational change;
* decisions over the job you are to return to after maternity leave;
* decisions on requests to work part-time or from home; or
* the content of your employee records.

This Grievance Procedure should not be used to complain about dismissal or disciplinary action. If you are dissatisfied with any disciplinary action, including dismissal, you should submit an appeal under the appropriate procedure set out at in this Handbook.

Telcom Networks has a separate Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy that may be useful if you have been the victim of bullying or harassment or wish to report an incident of bullying or harassment involving other people.

Telcom Networks also operates a separate Whistleblowing Policy to enable employees to  report alleged activities, wrongdoing or malpractice. However, where you are directly affected by the matter in question, or where you feel you have been victimised for an act of whistleblowing you may raise the matter under this Grievance Procedure.

## Notification
You must set down in writing the nature of your complaint indicating that it is a formal grievance and send the written complaint in the first instance to your Line Manager or, if your grievance concerns your Line Manager, to Senior Manager.

The written grievance should contain a brief description of the nature of your complaint including any relevant facts, dates and names of individuals involved. In some situations, we may ask you to provide further information.

## Grievance meeting
A meeting will be arranged, at a reasonable time and place, usually with your Line Manager or, if your grievance concerns your Line Manager, an alternative member of the management team, if practicable, within five working days of you lodging your grievance.

The purpose of the meeting will be to discuss and resolve the grievance and to assist us to reach a decision based on the available evidence and the representations you have made. Another manager will normally attend to take notes. You must make every effort to attend the meeting. You are entitled to be accompanied at a grievance meeting – for full details of this right see below.

After an initial grievance meeting, we may carry out further investigations and hold further meetings as we consider appropriate. Such meetings will be arranged without unreasonable delay.
Following conclusion of the grievance meeting and any investigation, the person conducting the grievance meeting will consider what action, if any, will be taken. You will be notified in writing of the decision and any action Telcom Networks proposes taking as soon as practicable. In most cases, this will be within five working days of the conclusion of the grievance meeting. If it is not practicable to respond within this time, for example because investigations are not completed, you will be given an explanation for the delay and told when a response can be expected. You will also be notified of your right to appeal against the decision if you are unhappy with it.

## Investigations
In some cases, it may be necessary for us to carry out an investigation into your grievance. The extent of any investigation required will depend on the nature of the allegations and will vary from case to case. It may involve interviewing and taking statements from you and any witnesses or reviewing relevant documents.

You must co-operate fully and promptly in any investigation. This may include informing us of the names of any relevant witnesses, disclosing any relevant documents to us and attending investigative interviews if required.

We may initiate an investigation before holding a grievance meeting where we consider this appropriate. In other cases, we may hold a grievance meeting before deciding what investigation (if any) to carry out. In such cases, we may, if appropriate, hold a further grievance meeting with you before we reach a decision.

## Appeal
If you are not satisfied with the decision, you should appeal in writing stating your full grounds of appeal to a Senior Manager within five working days of Telcom Network’s notification of its decision.

An appeal meeting will normally be arranged within five working days of receipt of your written appeal. Where possible, the appeal meeting will be conducted by a member of the management team not previously involved in the grievance. A Senior Manager or external advisor will normally be present to take notes.

The purpose of the appeal meeting will be to reconsider the decision relating to the grievance in order for the person conducting the appeal meeting to judge if the matter was properly considered. Any evidence that has subsequently come to light may also be taken into account and if you become aware of such evidence you should provide details of it to the person hearing the appeal as soon as practicable.

You must make every effort to attend the appeal meeting. You are entitled to be accompanied at an appeal meeting – for full details of this right, see below.

Following the appeal meeting, the person conducting it will decide what, if any, action will be taken. You will be notified of the appeal decision in writing as soon as practicable. In most cases, this will be within five working days of the appeal meeting. There is no further right of appeal beyond this stage and the appeal decision is final.

## Right to be accompanied
Your companion should be either (1) a work colleague employed by Telcom Networks; or (2) a full-time officer employed by a trade union, or a trade union official who has been reasonably certified in writing by their union as having experience of, or as having received training in, acting as a worker's companion at disciplinary or grievance hearings. You are not entitled to legal representation at the meeting.

Before a meeting takes place you should notify the person who is to conduct the meeting of the identity of your companion. If your choice of companion is unreasonable, for example, because of a conflict of interest or because their presence may prejudice the meeting, we may ask you to choose someone else.

Your companion may address the meeting in order to do any of the following:
* put your case;
* sum up that case;
* respond on your behalf to any view expressed at the meeting; and
* confer with you during the meeting. Telcom Networks is not obliged to allow your companion to:
* answer questions on your behalf;
* address the meeting if you indicate that you do not wish your companion to do so; or
* use the rights set out above in a way that prevents Telcom Network’s representative from explaining Telcom Network’s case or that prevents any other person at the meeting from making his contribution to it.

If your chosen companion is not available at the time proposed for the meeting, Telcom Networks will postpone the meeting to a time when you and they are available, provided that you propose an alternative time for the meeting which is reasonable and which is no later than five working days after the date originally set for the meeting.

If your chosen companion is a colleague employed by Telcom Networks, they will be given reasonable time off work to prepare for and attend the meeting(s). No person who acts or seeks to act as a companion as set out above will be subject to any detriment by reason of doing so.
