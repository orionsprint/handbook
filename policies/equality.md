# Equal Opportunities & Diversity Policy

Telcom Networks is committed to promoting equality of opportunity for all staff and job applicants.

We prohibit discrimination and/or harassment and are committed to the principle that we should all be able to work in an environment free from intimidation, bullying and harassment. We are fully committed to improving the working environment and creating further opportunities for all.

We are an equal opportunities employer and do not discriminate on the grounds of gender, sexual orientation, marital or civil partnership status, gender reassignment, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion or belief, disability or age (known as "Protected Characteristics").

The objective of Telcom Networks is to obtain the services of the individual best qualified for any given position by virtue of education, training, experience, physical abilities where applicable, and personal qualifications other than those related to race, creed, colour, religion, sex, national origin or other such matters.

The principles of non-discrimination and equality of opportunity also apply to the way in which staff of Telcom Networks treat visitors, clients, customers, suppliers and former staff.

All staff therefore have a duty to act in accordance with this policy and treat colleagues with dignity at all times, and not to discriminate against or harass other members of staff, regardless of their status. Your attention is drawn to our separate Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy, set out in this Handbook.

You are required to give your full support to these principles and policies. The making of jokes on any of the above subjects is inappropriate and a breach of Telcom Networks policy. Our behaviour whilst at work should be professional and appropriate at all times.

This policy applies to all aspects of your relationship with Telcom Networks and to relations between staff members at all levels. This includes job advertisements, recruitment and selection, training and development, opportunities for promotion, conditions of service, pay and benefits, conduct at work, disciplinary and grievance procedures and termination of employment.

Telcom Networks will take appropriate steps to accommodate the requirements of different religions, cultures and domestic responsibilities.

## Forms of discrimination
Discrimination by or against an employee is generally prohibited unless there is a specific legal exemption. Discrimination may be direct or indirect and it may occur intentionally or unintentionally.

Direct discrimination occurs where someone is treated less favourably because of one or more of the Protected Characteristics set out above. For example, rejecting an applicant on the grounds of their race because they would not "fit in" would be direct discrimination.

Indirect discrimination occurs where someone is disadvantaged by an unjustified provision, criterion or practice that also puts other people with the same Protected Characteristic at a particular disadvantage. For example, a minimum height requirement would be likely to eliminate proportionately more women than men. Such a requirement will need to be objectively justified.

Harassment related to any of the Protected Characteristics is prohibited. Harassment is unwanted conduct that has the purpose or effect of violating someone's dignity, or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for them. Harassment is dealt with further in our Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy set out in this Handbook.

Victimisation is also prohibited. This is less favourable treatment of someone who has complained or given information about discrimination or harassment, or supported someone else's complaint.

## Recruitment and selection
Telcom Networks aims to ensure that no job applicant suffers discrimination because of any of the Protected Characteristics above. Our recruitment procedures are reviewed to ensure that individuals are treated on the basis of their relevant merits and abilities. Job selection criteria are reviewed to ensure that they are relevant to the job and are not disproportionate. We endeavour to ensure that shortlisting of applicants is done by more than one person wherever possible.

Job advertisements should avoid stereotyping or using wording that may discourage groups with a particular protected characteristic from applying.

Applicants should not be asked about health or disability before a job offer is made. There are limited exceptions which should only be used with approval from a Senior Manager with external professional guidance if required. For example:
* questions necessary to establish if an applicant can perform an intrinsic part of the job (subject to any reasonable adjustments);
* questions to establish if an applicant is fit to attend an assessment or any reasonable adjustments that may be needed at interview or assessment;
* positive action to recruit disabled persons; or
* equal opportunities monitoring (which will not form part of the decision-making process).

Applicants should not be asked questions relating to any Protected Characteristic without the prior approval of a Senior Manager (who should first consider whether such matters are relevant and may lawfully be taken into account).

Telcom Networks is required by law to ensure that all employees are entitled to work in the UK. Assumptions about immigration status should not be made based on appearance or apparent nationality. All prospective employees, regardless of nationality, must be able to produce original documents (such as a passport) before employment starts, to satisfy current immigration legislation. The list of acceptable documents is available from the UK Border Agency.

## Employee training
Employee training needs will be identified through regular employee reviews of performance with their Line Manager. All employees will be given appropriate access to training to  enable them to progress within the organisation and all promotion decisions will be made on the basis of merit.

## Termination of employment
We will endeavour to ensure that redundancy criteria and procedures are fair and objective and are not directly or indirectly discriminatory.

We will also ensure that disciplinary procedures and penalties are applied without discrimination, whether they result in disciplinary warnings, dismissal or other disciplinary action.

## Disability discrimination
If you are disabled or become disabled, we encourage you to tell us about your condition so that we can support you as appropriate.

If you experience difficulties at work because of your disability, you may wish to contact a Senior Manager to discuss any reasonable adjustments that would help overcome or minimise the difficulty. The Company may be required to seek an external professional to consult with you and your medical adviser(s) about possible adjustments. We will consider the matter carefully and try to accommodate your needs within reason. If we consider a particular adjustment would not be reasonable we will explain our reasons and try to find an alternative solution where possible.

## Breaches of this policy
If you believe that you may have been discriminated against or been subject to harassment (see the Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy in this Handbook), you are encouraged to raise the matter through Telcom Networks' [Grievance Procedure](/policies/grievance.md), set out in this Handbook.

We will always endeavour to treat allegations regarding potential breaches of this policy in confidence and ensure they are investigated in accordance with the relevant procedure. Staff who make such allegations in good faith will not be victimised or treated less favourably as a result. False allegations which are found to have been made in bad faith will, however, be dealt with under our Disciplinary Procedure.

Any employee who is found to have committed an act of discrimination or harassment will be subject to disciplinary action. Such behaviour may constitute gross misconduct and, as such, may result in summary dismissal. We take a strict approach to serious breaches of this policy.
