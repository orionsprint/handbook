# Adoption Leave
This policy outlines the statutory rights and responsibilities of employees who adopt, and sets out the arrangements for adoption leave.

This policy does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and it may be amended at any time.

## Definitions
The definitions in this paragraph apply in this policy.

* **"Qualifying Week"**: the week, starting on a Sunday, in which you are notified in writing by an adoption agency of having been matched with a child.
* **"Expected Placement Date"**: the date on which an adoption agency expects that it will place a child into your care with a view to adoption.
* **"Ordinary Adoption Leave (OAL)"**: a period of up to 26 weeks' leave available to all employees who qualify for adoption leave under section 25.2.
* **"Additional Adoption Leave (AAL)"**: a  further  period  of  up  to  26  weeks'  leave  immediately following OAL.

## Eligibility
Adoption leave is only available if you are adopting through a UK adoption agency. It is not available if there is no agency involved, for example, if you are formally adopting a stepchild or other relative.

You are entitled to adoption leave if you meet all the following conditions:
* an adoption agency has given you written notice that it has matched you with a child for adoption and tells you the Expected Placement Date;
* you have notified the agency that you agree to the child being placed with you on the Expected Placement Date;
* you  have  been  continuously  employed  by  us  for  at  least  26  weeks  ending  with  the Qualifying Week; and
* your spouse or partner will not be taking adoption leave with their employer (although they may be entitled to take paternity leave).
Telcom Networks may request documentary evidence of the adoption. Adoption leave will be available for children adopted up to the age of 18. Only one period of leave will be available irrespective of whether more than one child is placed for adoption at the same time.

## Notification
OAL may start on a predetermined date no more than 14 days before the Expected Placement Date, or on the date of placement itself, but no later.

You must notify us of your intended start date. We will then write to you within 28 days to inform you of the date we will expect you to return to work if you take your full entitlement to adoption leave (Expected Return Date).

You can postpone your intended start date by informing us in writing at least 28 days before the original date or, if that is not possible, as soon as you can.

You can bring forward your intended start date by informing us in writing at least 28 days before the new start date or, if that is not possible, as soon as you can.

Shortly before your adoption leave starts we will discuss with you the arrangements for covering your work and the opportunities for you to remain in contact, should you wish to do so, during your leave. Unless you request otherwise, you will remain on circulation lists for internal news, job vacancies, training and work-related social events.

You have an entitlement to OAL leave of 26 weeks and AAL of a further 26 weeks. Notice of the expected date of placement must be given with the intended date of the start of the leave. The notice should be given within seven days of the notification of a match and the leave can start on the date of placement or not more than 14 days beforehand. You will have to give Telcom Networks documentary evidence from your adoption agency as proof of entitlement to Statutory adoption pay. Again this can be varied with 28 daysâ€™ prior notice. Telcom Networks will have 28 days to respond to your leave plans and will write to you setting out the date on which you expect to return to work if the full entitlement to adoption leave is taken.

## Statutory Adoption Pay
Statutory adoption pay (SAP) is payable for up to 39 weeks. It stops being payable if you return to work sooner or if the placement is disrupted. You are entitled to SAP if:
* you have been continuously employed for at least 26 weeks at the end of your Qualifying Week and are still employed by us during that week;
* your average weekly earnings during the eight weeks ending with the Qualifying Week (the Relevant Period) are not less than the lower earnings limit set by the Government; and
* you have given us the relevant notifications.

SAP is paid at a prescribed rate which is set by the Government for the relevant tax year, or at 90% of your average weekly earnings calculated over the Relevant Period if this is lower.

SAP accrues with each complete week of absence but payments shall be made on the next normal payroll date. Income Tax, National Insurance and pension contributions shall be deducted as appropriate.

If you leave employment for any reason (for example, if you resign or are made redundant) you shall still be eligible for SAP if you have already been notified by an agency that you have been matched with a child. In such cases, SAP shall start:
* 14 days before the Expected Placement Date; or
* the day after your employment ends, whichever is the later.

If you become eligible for a pay rise before the end of your adoption leave, you will be treated for SAP purposes as if the pay rise had applied throughout the Relevant Period. This means that your SAP will be recalculated and increased retrospectively, or that you may qualify for SAP if you did not previously qualify. We shall pay you a lump sum to make up the difference between any SAP already paid and the amount payable by virtue of the pay rise. Any future SAP payments at the Earnings-Related Rate (if any) will also be increased as necessary.

Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP) is also payable on the adoption of a child. However, you cannot claim both SPP and SAP and must choose which right you wish to elect to receive. The entitlement to SPP for birth or adoption of a child is dependent on you having 26 weeks' service immediately prior to the 14th week before the EWC or notification of the match and you having earnings above the lower earnings limit. Telcom Networks may at its discretion pay three days at full pay. The remainder of the leave will be paid at the statutory rate or pro rata if less than one week.

## Terms and conditions during OAL and AAL
All the terms and conditions of your employment remain in force during OAL and AAL, except for the terms relating to pay. In particular:
* benefits in kind if applicable shall continue;
* annual leave entitlement under your contract shall continue to accrue; and
* pension benefits if applicable shall continue.

## Annual Leave
During OAL and AAL, annual leave will accrue at the rate provided under your contract.

Annual leave cannot usually be carried over from one holiday year to the next. If the holiday year is due to end during your adoption leave, you should ensure that you have taken the full year's entitlement before starting your adoption leave.

Telcom Networks holiday year runs from 1 January to 31 December.

## Keeping in touch
We may make reasonable contact with you from time to time during your adoption leave.

You may work (including attending training) on up to ten days during adoption leave without bringing your adoption leave to an end. This is not compulsory and arrangements, including any additional pay, would be discussed and agreed with your Line Manager.

Shortly before you are due to return to work, we may invite you to have a discussion (whether in person or by telephone) about the arrangements for your return. This may cover:
* updating you on any changes that have occurred during your absence;
* any training needs you might have; and
* any changes to working arrangements (for example, if you have made a request to work part time).

## Expected return date
Once you have notified us in writing of your intended start date, we shall send you a letter within 28 days to inform you of your expected return date. If your start date changes we shall write to you within 28 days of the start of adoption leave with a revised Expected Return Date.

We will expect you back at work on your expected return date unless you tell us otherwise. It will help us if, during your adoption leave, you are able to confirm that you will be returning to work as expected.
