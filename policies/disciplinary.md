# Disciplinary Procedure

This procedure is designed to help and encourage all employees of Telcom Networks achieve and maintain standards of conduct, attendance and job performance. The aim is to ensure consistent and fair treatment for all.

Minor conduct or performance issues can often be resolved informally between you and your Line Manager. These discussions should be held in private and without undue delay whenever there is cause for concern. Formal steps will be taken under this procedure if the matter is not resolved or if informal discussion is not appropriate.

You will not normally be dismissed for a first act of misconduct unless Telcom Networks decides it amounts to gross misconduct or you have not yet completed your probationary period.

Telcom Networks will make reasonable adjustments to this procedure and its operation to cater for employees (or their companions) who have a disability or because English is not their first language. If you think that such adjustments are required in your case, you should inform your Line Manager.
This procedure does not form part of any employees' contract of employment and we may amend it at any time.

## Confidentiality
Telcom Networkâ€™s aim is to deal with disciplinary matters sensitively and with due respect for the privacy of any individuals involved. All employees must treat any information communicated to them in connection with an investigation or disciplinary matter as confidential.

You will normally be told the names of any witnesses whose evidence is relevant to disciplinary proceedings against you, unless Telcom Networks considers that the identity of a witness should remain confidential.

## Suspension and investigation
At any stage of a Disciplinary Procedure or before it begins, Telcom Networks may suspend you on full pay, if appropriate. The suspension will be for no longer than is necessary to investigate the complaint against you and we will confirm the arrangements in writing. Suspension of this kind is not a disciplinary penalty and does not imply any assumption of guilt. Full pay means the basic rate of pay to which you are contractually entitled at the start of the suspension. Your contractual benefits will continue during any such suspension.

The purpose of an investigation is for Telcom Networks to establish a fair and balanced view of the facts relating to any complaint against you, before deciding whether to proceed with a disciplinary meeting. The amount of investigation required will depend on the nature of the complaint and will vary from case to case. It may involve interviewing and taking statements from you and any witnesses and reviewing relevant documents.

Investigative interviews are solely for the purpose of fact-finding and no decision on disciplinary action will be taken until after a disciplinary meeting has been held. You do not normally have the right to bring a companion to an investigative interview. However, we may allow you to bring a companion if it helps you to overcome any disability, or any difficulty in understanding English.

You must co-operate fully and promptly in any investigation. This will include informing us of the names of any relevant witnesses, disclosing any relevant documents to us and attending investigative interviews if required.

## Notification
Following any investigation, if Telcom Networks considers there may be grounds for disciplinary action, you will be required to attend a disciplinary meeting. You will be informed in writing of the nature of the complaint against you which has led Telcom Networks to consider disciplinary action, the basis for the complaint, for example, the detail of the conduct in question that Telcom Networks has taken into account, and the possible consequences if Telcom Networks decides after the meeting that the complaint against you is well founded.

Telcom Networks will, if appropriate, provide you with a copy of the following:
* a summary of relevant information gathered during the investigation;
* a copy of any relevant documents which will be used at the disciplinary meeting; and
* a copy of any relevant witness statements, except where a witness's identity is to be kept confidential, in which case we will give you as much information as possible while maintaining confidentiality.

You will be given reasonable notice of the time and place of the disciplinary meeting, which, in a case where a final written warning or dismissal is a possible outcome, will usually be a minimum of 48 hours' notice. The purpose of the meeting will be to consider the complaint against you and to allow you to state your case.

## Disciplinary meeting
The meeting will be conducted by an appropriate Manager and usually a suitable Manager or external advisor. Telcom Networks may require other persons to attend the meeting as appropriate, for example as a note taker or as a witness.

You must make every effort to attend the meeting. You are entitled to be accompanied at the meeting if you wish - further details below.

At the meeting, the person conducting it will explain the complaint against you and will go through the evidence that has been gathered (for example the concerns regarding your conduct or performance).     You  will  then  have  the  opportunity  to set  out  your  case  (including  where You will normally be told the names of any witnesses whose evidence is relevant to disciplinary proceedings against you, unless Telcom Networks considers that the identity of a witness should remain confidential.

## Notification
Following any investigation, if Telcom Networks considers there may be grounds for disciplinary action, you will be required to attend a disciplinary meeting. You will be informed in writing of the nature of the complaint against you which has led Telcom Networks to consider disciplinary action, the basis for the complaint, for example, the detail of the conduct in question that Telcom Networks has taken into account, and the possible consequences if Telcom Networks decides after the meeting that the complaint against you is well founded.

## Disciplinary meeting
The meeting will be conducted by an appropriate Manager and usually a suitable Manager or external advisor. Telcom Networks may require other persons to attend the meeting as appropriate, for example as a note taker or as a witness.

You must make every effort to attend the meeting. You are entitled to be accompanied at the meeting if you wish - further details below.

At the meeting, the person conducting it will explain the complaint against you and will go through the evidence that has been gathered (for example the concerns regarding your conduct or performance).     You  will  then  have  the  opportunity  to  set  out  your  case  (including  where appropriate, to answer any allegations that have been made, ask questions, present evidence and raise points about any information provided by witnesses) and to respond to the matters raised. You may also make any other statements or observations relevant to the issues. You may put these in writing if you wish but, if you do, you must provide a copy to the person chairing the meeting in good time before the meeting. Failure to do so may result in the meeting being delayed. You may ask relevant witnesses to appear at the meeting, provided you give us sufficient advance notice to arrange their attendance. You will not normally be permitted to cross examine witnesses unless, in exceptional circumstances, Telcom Networks decides that a fair hearing could not be heard otherwise.

Telcom Networks may adjourn the disciplinary meeting if it needs to carry out any further investigations such as re-interviewing witnesses in light of any new points you have raised at the meeting. You will be given a reasonable opportunity to consider any new information obtained before the meeting is reconvened.

Following conclusion of the meeting, the person conducting it will consider what action, if any, will be taken. You will be notified of the decision in writing as soon as practicable. In most cases this will be within five working days of the disciplinary meeting. You will also be notified of your right to appeal against the decision if you are unhappy with it.

## Appeal
If you feel that the disciplinary action taken against you is wrong or unjust, you should appeal in writing stating your full grounds of appeal to your Line Manager within five working days of Telcom Networkâ€™s notification of its decision.

An appeal meeting will normally be arranged within five working days of receipt of your written appeal. Where possible, the appeal meeting will be conducted by a member of the management team not previously involved in the disciplinary matter. A senior Manager or external advisor will normally be present to take notes.

The purpose of the appeal meeting will be to reconsider the outcome of the disciplinary meeting in order for the person conducting the appeal meeting to judge if the matter was properly considered and (where relevant) any sanction properly imposed. Any evidence that has subsequently come to light may also be taken into account and, if you become aware of such evidence, you should provide details of it to the person hearing the appeal as soon as practicable.

You must make every effort to attend the appeal meeting. You are entitled to be accompanied at an appeal meeting â€“ full details of this right are set out below.

Following the appeal meeting, the person conducting it will decide what, if any, action will be taken. You will be notified of the appeal decision in writing as soon as practicable. In most cases this will be within five working days of the appeal meeting. There is no further right of appeal beyond this stage and the appeal decision is final.

## Conduct of meetings
Meetings under this procedure will be arranged at reasonable times and locations.

Electronic recording, by you or any companion, of the proceedings of any meeting is not permitted under any circumstances.

If you cannot attend the disciplinary or appeal meeting you should inform the inviting line manager immediately and an alternative time will be arranged. Failure to attend a hearing without good reason may be treated as misconduct in itself. If you fail to attend without good reason, or are persistently unable to do so (for example, for health reasons), Telcom Networks may have to take a decision based on the available evidence. If this is the case, Telcom Networks will inform you of its intention to do so.

## Disciplinary action
Disciplinary action may take a number of forms:
* performance improvement and review process (other than a normal performance review process).  This may accompany a warning;
* a formal verbal warning (for example for a minor or persistent misdemeanour or problems related to performance);
* a first written warning (for example for more serious problems regarding behaviour or performance, where a previous offence has been repeated or where performance has not improved despite earlier warnings);
* a final written warning (for example for further repetition of minor offences, persistent failure to meet previously set performance standards or serious problems with performance or behaviour);
* dismissal (with notice) (for example, further or more serious repetition of behaviour which has previously led to a warning or failure to improve performance standards outlined in previous warning);
* summary dismissal (without notice) (for example, for gross misconduct - see   section 8.8 below); or
* alternatives to dismissal (see below).
The above list is not exhaustive. In appropriate cases, more than one form of disciplinary action may be imposed.
In cases justifying dismissal (with or without notice), we may, at our discretion, impose as an alternative to dismissal one or more of the following forms of disciplinary action:
* suspension for a period of up to three months, without pay or on part pay;
* demotion; or
* reduction in base salary

The fact that one person has been subject to particular disciplinary action or dismissal will not set a precedent for any other case.

Any disciplinary warning will remain "active" for a specified period â€“ unless you are notified otherwise in any letter confirming the disciplinary action, verbal warnings will remain active for six months and written warnings for 12 months. At the end of the active period of the warning, the warning will no longer be taken into account in determining any further disciplinary action against you, but a note of it will remain permanently on your personnel file.

## Gross misconduct
Offences which, in Telcom Networkâ€™s view, amount to gross misconduct may result in summary dismissal. This means that regardless of your previous disciplinary record, you may be dismissed without notice or payment in lieu of notice. If you are suspected of gross misconduct you will be informed of this and of the potential outcome at the time that you are notified of the disciplinary meeting.

Gross misconduct includes, but is not limited to:
* theft or fraud;
* falsification of documents;
* breach of Telcom Networkâ€™s Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy;
* physical assault or threat of assault;
* harassment, discrimination, bullying or victimisation of any kind;
* deliberate damage to Telcom Networkâ€™s property;
* persistent unwarranted absence;
* abuse of Telcom Networkâ€™s computer system or breach of Telcom Networkâ€™s IT Policy;
* dishonesty;
* any behaviour damaging or potentially damaging to Telcom Networkâ€™s reputation, whether this takes place at or outside work;
* breach of confidentiality;
* serious breach of your contract of employment;
* insubordination;
* serious breach of any of Telcom Networkâ€™s policies or of the rules of any body which regulates Telcom Networks;
* giving false information as to qualifications or entitlement to work (including immigration status);
* breach of health and safety rules and regulations; and
* use of illegal drugs or incapacity at work due to alcohol or other substances.

## Right to be accompanied
Your companion may be either (1) a work colleague; or (2) a full-time officer employed by a trade union, or a trade union official who has been reasonably certified in writing by their union as having experience of, or as having received training in, acting as a worker's companion at disciplinary or grievance hearings. You are not entitled to legal representation at the meeting.

Before the meeting takes place you should notify the person who is to conduct the meeting of the identity of your companion. If your choice of companion is unreasonable, for example, because of a conflict of interest or because their presence may prejudice the meeting, we may ask you to choose someone else.

Your companion may address the meeting in order to do any or all of the following:
* put your case;
* sum up that case;
* respond on your behalf to any view expressed at the meeting; and
* confer with you during the meeting. Telcom Networks is not obliged to allow your companion to:
* answer questions on your behalf;
* address the meeting if you indicate that you do not wish your companion to do so; or
* use the rights set out above in a way that prevents Telcom Networkâ€™s representative from explaining Telcom Networkâ€™s case or that prevents any other person at the meeting from making his contribution to it.

If your chosen companion is not available at the time proposed for the meeting, we will postpone the meeting to a time when you and they are available, provided that you propose an alternative time for the meeting which is reasonable and which is no later than five working days after the date originally set for the meeting.

If your chosen companion is a colleague employed by Telcom Networks, they will be given reasonable time off work to prepare for and attend the meeting(s). No person who acts or seeks to act as a companion as set out above will be subject to any detriment by reason of doing so.
